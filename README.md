# MNIST Digit Classification Project

This project is focused on building and deploying a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The SVM model is trained, evaluated, and then serialized into a file for later use in a simple Python application (`app.py`) that can make predictions on new data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, you need to have Python 3.6+ installed along with the following Python packages:

- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
- pickle (for model serialization)

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib pickle-mixin
```

### Installing

1. **Clone the repository**: Get a local copy of the project by running:

   ```bash
   git clone https://yourprojectrepository.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd path_to_your_project
   ```

3. **Install the required packages** (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This assumes you have a `requirements.txt` file listing all the necessary packages.

### File Structure

- `model.pkl`: The serialized SVM model trained on the MNIST dataset.
- `app.py`: A Python script that demonstrates how to load the SVM model and use it to make predictions.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading that provides project documentation.

## Running the Application

To run the application and make predictions with the pre-trained model:

1. **Ensure your MNIST images** are placed in a designated directory if `app.py` is set up to predict on new images. The path to this directory should be specified in `app.py`.

2. **Execute `app.py`** by running:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   This script will load the pre-trained model and perform classification on the provided images, outputting the predictions.

## How It Works

- The SVM classifier is trained on the MNIST dataset, which includes 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).
- After training, the model is serialized into `model.pkl` using pickle.
- `app.py` loads this model and uses it to predict the digits of new handwritten images.

## Expected Outputs

After running `app.py`, the console will display the predicted digit for each image processed by the script. Ensure that your script handles reading images from a directory and making predictions accordingly.
